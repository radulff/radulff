## Hi there 👋,

### I'm Raül Vila, I consider myself a disciplined, code-crunching aficionado with a work ethic that could rival the Energizer Bunny. Passionately building and breaking things as a developer, turning caffeine into code. In progress of conquering the digital realms one bug at a time.
